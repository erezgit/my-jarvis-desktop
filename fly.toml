# All infrastructure is managed programmatically via Next.js frontend

# No [http_service] section - prevents fly deploy from creating machines
# No [machine] section - prevents fly deploy from creating machines
# No [[vm]] section - prevents fly deploy from creating machines

# All machines are created dynamically via Machines API with:
# - User-specific JWT tokens in environment variables
# - User-specific volume attachments
# - On-demand creation and destruction
# - Custom routing through my-jarvis-runtime.fly.dev domain
