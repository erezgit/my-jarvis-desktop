# Mobile Architecture Comparison: Current vs Working

## Root Cause: Nested Height Conflicts

**The Critical Issue**: ChatPage uses `min-h-screen` and `h-screen` which creates **100vh + locked viewport height = conflict**

When MobileLayout locks viewport at 100vh using `--vh`, and ChatPage ALSO tries to be 100vh (`h-screen`), we get:
- Double height containers
- Scrolling in wrong places
- Zoom behavior from browser trying to fit oversized content
- Input field disappearing because container is taller than locked viewport

## Current Architecture (BROKEN)

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ MobileScrollLock                            │  ← Sets --vh = window.innerHeight * 0.01
│ └─ div (height: calc(var(--vh) * 100))     │  ← Locked to 100vh equivalent
│    ├─ Navigation Bar (sticky, flex-shrink) │  ← Top buttons (files/preview/chat)
│    └─ Panel Container (flex-1, overflow)   │  ← Available space
│       └─ Chat Panel (h-full, flex-col)     │  ← Should fill Panel Container
│          └─ ChatPage                        │  ⚠️ PROBLEM STARTS HERE
│             ├─ Outer: min-h-screen         │  ⚠️ Allows growth beyond parent!
│             └─ Inner: h-screen (100vh)     │  ⚠️ Fixed 100vh AGAIN!
│                ├─ Header (flex-shrink-0)   │
│                ├─ Content / Messages        │  ⚠️ Nested h-screen creates scroll
│                └─ ChatInput                 │  ⚠️ Gets pushed down
└─────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### The Conflict Chain

1. **MobileLayout locks viewport**: `height: calc(var(--vh, 1vh) * 100)` = 100vh
2. **Panel Container gets flex-1**: Takes remaining space (100vh - nav bar)
3. **Chat Panel gets h-full**: Tries to fill Panel Container
4. **ChatPage uses min-h-screen + h-screen**: Tries to be 100vh AGAIN
5. **Result**: ChatPage (100vh) inside Panel Container (~90vh) = overflow
6. **Browser behavior**: Creates scrollable area with weird zoom

### Why It Breaks

**Scroll Behavior**:
- User scrolls UP → sees white background (scrolling the MobileLayout container)
- Keyboard appears → ChatPage's 100vh doesn't fit in locked viewport
- Browser zooms IN to fit the oversized content
- Input field gets pushed below visible area

**Height Stack**:
```
MobileLayout:     100vh (locked)
  Navigation:      ~40px
  Panel Container: flex-1 (~90vh available)
    Chat Panel:    h-full (tries to be 90vh)
      ChatPage:    min-h-screen + h-screen (100vh) ⚠️
```

**Result**: 100vh content in ~90vh container = scrolling + zoom issues

## Working Architecture (my-jarvis-frontend)

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ MobileScrollLock                            │  ← Sets --vh = window.innerHeight * 0.01
│ └─ div (h-full, flex-col)                  │  ✅ Uses parent height
│    ├─ TokenContextBar (fixed)              │  ← Header (fixed height)
│    ├─ Messages (flex-1, overflow-y-scroll) │  ✅ Takes available space, scrolls
│    └─ form (fixed, pb-4)                   │  ← Input (fixed at bottom)
│       └─ ChatInput                          │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Why It Works

**Single Height Source**:
- Parent sets height ONCE (via `--vh`)
- All children use relative sizing (`h-full`, `flex-1`)
- No nested `100vh` conflicts

**Three-Zone Flex Layout**:
1. **Header**: Fixed height, stays at top
2. **Messages**: `flex-1` + `overflow-y-scroll` = takes all available space, scrolls internally
3. **Input**: Fixed height, stays at bottom

**Height Stack**:
```
Parent:           100vh (locked via --vh)
  TokenBar:       ~60px (fixed)
  Messages:       flex-1 (fills remaining ~87vh) + overflow-y-scroll
  Form/Input:     ~53px (fixed)
```

**Result**: Everything fits perfectly, messages scroll internally, input stays visible

## Key Architectural Differences

### 1. Height Management

| Current (Broken) | Working |
|-----------------|---------|
| `min-h-screen` on ChatPage outer | `h-full` uses parent height |
| `h-screen` on ChatPage inner | `flex-col` with `flex-1` children |
| Creates 100vh inside locked ~90vh | Single height source propagates down |
| Double height = overflow + scroll | Clean hierarchy = stable layout |

### 2. Scroll Container

| Current (Broken) | Working |
|-----------------|---------|
| Multiple scroll contexts | Single scroll context |
| ChatMessages has `overflow-y-auto` | Messages has `overflow-y-scroll` |
| Unclear scroll boundaries | Clear: only messages scroll |
| Margin-based spacing | Flex-based spacing |

### 3. Input Position

| Current (Broken) | Working |
|-----------------|---------|
| Input separate from flex flow | Input inside flex container |
| No direct relationship to messages | Part of three-zone layout |
| Position relative to nested container | Position relative to locked viewport |

### 4. Viewport Locking Application

| Current (Broken) | Working |
|-----------------|---------|
| Lock at MobileLayout level | Lock at parent level |
| Child ignores with `h-screen` | All children respect via `h-full` |
| Conflict between locked + fixed | Harmony via relative sizing |

## The Specific Issues You're Seeing

### Issue 1: "Can scroll up, see white background"
**Cause**: ChatPage's `min-h-screen` allows content to be taller than MobileLayout's locked viewport.

**Why**:
```
MobileLayout (100vh locked) contains:
  └─ ChatPage (min-h-screen allows >100vh growth)
```

### Issue 2: "Clicking input makes everything zoom in"
**Cause**: Browser's viewport resizing behavior conflicts with nested `h-screen`.

**Why**:
1. Keyboard appears
2. Browser tries to keep input visible
3. ChatPage's `h-screen` (100vh) doesn't fit in visible area after keyboard
4. Browser zooms to fit the oversized fixed-height content

### Issue 3: "Entry field gets cut/disappears"
**Cause**: ChatPage's `h-screen` inner container creates fixed 100vh space. When keyboard appears:
```
Available viewport: ~50vh (after keyboard)
ChatPage inner: 100vh (fixed)
Input position: bottom of 100vh container = below visible area
```

### Issue 4: "More zoom after sending message"
**Cause**: New message causes scroll, browser tries to keep input visible, but fixed heights prevent proper adjustment.

## The Fix: Single Source of Height Truth

### What Needs to Change in ChatPage

**Current**:
```tsx
<div className="min-h-screen ...">                    ⚠️ Remove
  <div className="max-w-6xl mx-auto h-screen ...">    ⚠️ Remove
```

**Should Be** (for mobile via MobileLayout):
```tsx
<div className="h-full flex flex-col ...">            ✅ Respect parent
  <div className="max-w-6xl mx-auto flex-1 ...">      ✅ Use flex
```

### The Solution Path

1. **Remove height overrides from ChatPage**
   - Change `min-h-screen` → `h-full`
   - Change inner `h-screen` → `flex-1`

2. **MobileLayout already correct**
   - Has MobileScrollLock ✅
   - Has locked viewport height ✅
   - Passes h-full to ChatPage container ✅

3. **ChatPage needs to cooperate**
   - Must respect parent height, not declare its own
   - Must use flex layout, not fixed vh units
   - Must propagate flex constraints to children

### Why This Will Fix Everything

**After Fix**:
```
MobileLayout (100vh locked)
  └─ Chat Panel (h-full = 90vh)
     └─ ChatPage (h-full = 90vh) ✅ Now matches!
        ├─ Header (fixed)
        ├─ Messages (flex-1, scroll)
        └─ Input (fixed)
```

- No double height declarations
- No overflow scrolling at wrong level
- No zoom (content fits locked viewport)
- Input stays visible (part of locked layout)

---

## Summary

**Root Cause**: ChatPage declares `min-h-screen` + `h-screen` which conflicts with MobileLayout's locked viewport height.

**Symptom Chain**:
1. MobileLayout locks to 100vh
2. ChatPage tries to be 100vh inside ~90vh container
3. Overflow creates scrollable area
4. Browser zooms to fit oversized content
5. Input gets pushed below visible area

**Solution**: Make ChatPage respect parent height using `h-full` and `flex-1` instead of declaring its own `h-screen`.

**Implementation**: Conditional styling for mobile vs desktop, OR separate mobile-specific ChatPage layout.
