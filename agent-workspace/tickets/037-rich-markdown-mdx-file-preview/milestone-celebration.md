# Milestone Celebration - Ticket 037 Completion

## üéâ Major Achievement Unlocked

We've just completed a significant milestone in My Jarvis Desktop development:

### What We Accomplished
- **Production Build Stability**: Running successfully from my-jarvis app
- **Legacy Integration**: Working from my-jarvis-desktop-old app
- **Production Quality**: Stable build that's been reliable
- **Rich File Preview**: Complete Markdown/MDX rendering implementation

## üîç Next Focus: File Creation UX Issue

### Current Behavior (To Test)
When creating a new file (like implementation plans in tickets):
- File gets created successfully
- **Issue**: File doesn't automatically appear/open in preview
- **User Action Required**: Must manually click the file to view it
- **Inconsistency**: Behavior is not consistent

### Desired Behavior
- File creation should trigger automatic preview display
- New files should immediately show in the file tree
- User shouldn't need to manually locate and click new files

## Test Case
This document itself serves as a test:
1. Create `milestone-celebration.md` in ticket 037
2. Observe if it automatically appears in preview panel
3. Check if manual click is needed to view content
