METHODOLOGY DISCUSSION TRANSLATION

At this time, my practice is to work just as I worked yesterday with Lichtman, and as I am currently working with you. Essentially, I come in, sort out this situation, do my login with both the cloud code and the AI approach, to give you a good initial experience, and once you've experienced it, it's as if with Lichtman, for example, I haven't yet switched it entirely to my user. I've totally transferred it to my user account, and I don’t want him to think about it all. As long as he understands and is on board, in the next meeting I'll fully switch him over to my user profile. 

It's simply a matter of working with the MD cloud. A matter of improving the MD cloud and telling it, "From now on you're writing primarily in TSX". It's like having a dashboard, Markdown file is for these sorts of things, TSX is for those sorts of things. If a user now requests to create some kind of action plan, then produce it attractively in Markdown, as if it's already a TSX file. And then, the user doesn’t need to make a request. He already knows which format to provide. 

Everything needs to progress in baby steps, okay? First of all, I tell everyone who's involved, this thing is experimental. Cloud code is an experimental tool.
