## 🎯 Core Methodology Overview

Yaron has developed a systematic, human-centered approach to onboarding clients into the Jarvis AI platform. His methodology is built around **experience-first adoption** with **personalized consulting** rather than generic tool deployment.

---

## 🔄 The Three-Phase Client Journey

### Phase 1: Experience-First Demo (Meeting 1)
**Objective:** Create immediate value perception without technical friction

**Process:**
1. **Pre-Setup Strategy**
   - Yaron uses his own credentials (Claude Code + OpenAI API)
   - Client experiences full platform capabilities immediately
   - Zero technical setup barriers during evaluation

2. **Interview-Based Discovery**
   - Systematic questioning about client's work
   - What do they do? How do they do it?
   - Where do they spend time? What are their pain points?
   - What repetitive tasks do they have?

3. **Real-Time Solution Building**
   - Live demonstration of problem-solving
   - Build actual deliverables during the meeting
   - Show differentiation from GPT/Claude basic interfaces
   - Client leaves with concrete, usable outputs

### Phase 2: Knowledge Transfer (Meeting 2-3)
**Objective:** Transition to independent usage

**Process:**
1. **Account Transition**
   - Transfer to client's own credentials
   - Only after they're convinced of value

2. **Foundation Training**
   - How to communicate with Jarvis
   - How to make requests effectively
   - File upload and management
   - Capability overview (TSX, PDF, Markdown, etc.)

3. **Industry-Specific Starter Kit**
   - Custom templates for their domain
   - Pre-built prompts for common tasks
   - Role-specific workflow patterns

### Phase 3: Autonomy Development (Meetings 3-4)
**Objective:** Achieve client independence

**Process:**
1. **Usage Monitoring & Optimization**
   - Observe actual usage patterns
   - Identify improvement areas
   - Fix non-functional elements

2. **Advanced Feature Adoption**
   - Voice-first collaboration
   - Project management integration
   - Advanced file manipulation

3. **Success Validation**
   - Retention metrics
   - Usage frequency
   - Delivered value measurement
