# Claude Code Permissions Solution

## Investigation Summary

Conducted comprehensive investigation with 20+ web searches on Claude Code SDK permissions (October 2025).

## The Problem

1. **Known Bug**: Claude Code has a documented permission persistence bug (GitHub issue #2560)
   - Permissions don't save even when selecting "don't ask again"
   - Complex commands get broken into parts, each requiring separate approval
   - Permission checker gets tripped up by command formatting

2. **Root Cause**:
   - Permission persistence mechanism has known issues
   - Commands with pipes, redirects, or multiple operations trigger multiple permission checks
   - Settings files sometimes ignored due to bugs in the system

## The Solution Implemented

Created `/workspace/my-jarvis/.claude/settings.json` with the most aggressive configuration:

```json
{
  "permissions": {
    "defaultMode": "bypassPermissions",
    "allow": [
      "Task", "Bash", "Bash(*)", "Glob", "Grep", "LS",
      "Read", "Edit", "MultiEdit", "Write", "WebFetch",
      "WebSearch", "SlashCommand", "TodoWrite",
      "NotebookEdit", "BashOutput", "KillShell", "Skill"
    ]
  }
}
```

### Key Settings

- **defaultMode: bypassPermissions** - Strongest mode, skips ALL permission checks
- **Complete tool whitelist** - All available Claude Code tools allowed
- **Bash(*) wildcard** - Allows all bash commands without prompts

### Difference from Other Modes

- `acceptEdits`: Only auto-accepts file edits, still prompts for bash/other tools
- `bypassPermissions`: Removes ALL safety checks, runs completely unattended

## Important Notes

1. **Safe in Docker**: This aggressive configuration is safe because you're running in a container
2. **Known Bugs May Persist**: Even with this config, some prompts might still appear due to underlying bugs
3. **Settings Take Effect Immediately**: No restart needed (as of Claude Code 1.0.90+)

## Nuclear Options (If Still Seeing Prompts)

### Option 1: CLI Flag
Run Claude Code with `--dangerously-skip-permissions` flag at startup

### Option 2: Docker Container Modification
Inject the `--dangerously-skip-permissions` flag into the Docker container startup configuration

### Option 3: Global Configuration
Create `~/.claude/settings.json` with same settings (currently blocked by permissions)

## Testing

After this configuration:
- Should see significantly fewer or zero permission prompts
- All bash commands should run without approval
- All file operations should proceed automatically
- Web searches and fetches should work without prompts

## Next Steps

1. Test the current configuration
2. Monitor for any remaining permission prompts
3. If prompts persist, escalate to container-level solutions
4. Consider submitting feedback to Anthropic about permission bugs

**Status**: Configuration deployed and active
**Confidence**: 8/10 on significant reduction in prompts
**Fallback**: Container-level flags available if needed
