# Ticket #058: Critical Bug Fixes - Workspace Persistence & Mobile Permissions

**Status:** ✅ Completed
**Priority:** Critical
**Date:** 2025-10-12
**Version:** 1.30.0

---

## Summary

Fixed two critical production bugs affecting My Jarvis Desktop:
1. **Permission popup infinite loop on mobile browsers**
2. **Workspace files deleted on every deployment**

Both issues were identified, root-caused, and fixed with production deployments.

## Bug #1: Permission Popup Infinite Loop on Mobile

### Issue Description
- **Symptoms:** Permission popup appeared in infinite loop on mobile browsers
- **User Experience:** User clicks "Allow" → popup closes → hangs → popup appears again
- **Environment:** Mobile browsers (iOS/Android) - Desktop worked fine
- **Impact:** Mobile users unable to grant permissions, blocking file operations

### Root Cause
**Location:** `app/hooks/chat/usePermissions.ts:64-70`

```typescript
const allowToolTemporary = useCallback(
  (pattern: string, baseTools?: string[]) => {
    const currentAllowedTools = baseTools || allowedTools;
    return [...currentAllowedTools, pattern];  // ❌ NO state update!
  },
  [allowedTools],
);
```

**The Problem:**
1. `allowToolTemporary` created new array but **never updated React state**
2. `handlePermissionAllow` built `updatedAllowedTools` as local variable
3. On mobile, async/timing differences caused variable to be lost
4. Backend received empty `allowedTools` state → thought permission never granted
5. Loop continued infinitely

**Why Desktop Worked:**
- Faster JavaScript execution
- Local variable survived async operations
- No timing issues

### Solution Implemented

Updated `allowToolTemporary` to persist state like `allowToolPermanent`:

```typescript
const allowToolTemporary = useCallback(
  (pattern: string, baseTools?: string[]) => {
    const currentAllowedTools = baseTools || allowedTools;
    const updatedAllowedTools = [...currentAllowedTools, pattern];
    setAllowedTools(updatedAllowedTools);  // ✅ Update state!
    return updatedAllowedTools;
  },
  [allowedTools],
);
```

### Files Changed
- `app/hooks/chat/usePermissions.ts` - Added `setAllowedTools` call
- `package.json` - Version bump to 1.30.0

### Commit
```
7891309d - fix: Resolve permission popup infinite loop on mobile browsers
```

### Testing
- ✅ Desktop browser: Permissions work (already working)
- ✅ Mobile browser: Permissions work (now fixed)
- ✅ No infinite loops
- ✅ File operations complete successfully

## Bug #2: Workspace Files Deleted on Every Deployment

### Issue Description
- **Symptoms:** All user-created files disappeared after redeployment
- **User Experience:** Create `.env` with API key → redeploy → API key gone
- **Environment:** Render.com Docker deployment
- **Impact:** Users lose work, need to recreate files after every deployment

### Root Cause Analysis

**Location:** `scripts/init-workspace.sh:15`

```bash
# TEMPORARY: Forces clean rebuild of workspace (except .claude directory)
# TODO: Add back conditional check after first deployment

# Clean workspace (preserve .claude directory for auth persistence)
echo "[Init] Cleaning workspace (preserving .claude)..."
find "$WORKSPACE_PARENT" -mindepth 1 -maxdepth 1 ! -name '.claude' -exec rm -rf {} + 2>/dev/null || true
```

**The Problem:**
1. Script runs on **EVERY deployment** (called from Dockerfile CMD)
2. `find` command **DELETES EVERYTHING** except `.claude` folder
3. Was meant to be temporary for testing
4. Left in production code, destroying user files
5. Template files copied fresh each time, overwriting user changes

**Persistent Disk Setup:**
- Render.yaml configured persistent disk at `/workspace` (10GB)
- Disk mount works correctly
- But script wipes files before mount can preserve them

### Solution Implemented

Added conditional check using marker file pattern:

```bash
MARKER_FILE="$WORKSPACE_PARENT/CLAUDE.md"

# Check if workspace is already initialized (CLAUDE.md exists)
if [ -f "$MARKER_FILE" ]; then
    echo "[Init] ✅ Workspace already initialized - preserving user files"
    echo "[Init] Skipping template copy to preserve user data"
    # Ensure .claude directory exists for auth
    mkdir -p "$WORKSPACE_PARENT/.claude"
    exit 0
fi

# First run: Initialize workspace from template
echo "[Init] 🚀 First run detected - initializing workspace from template..."
# ... copy template files ...
```

**How It Works:**
1. **First deployment:** No `CLAUDE.md` → Initialize from template
2. **Subsequent deployments:** `CLAUDE.md` exists → Skip initialization, preserve ALL files
3. Only `.claude` auth folder managed separately

### Files Changed
- `scripts/init-workspace.sh` - Complete rewrite with conditional logic

### Commit
```
82b8d2ff - fix: Prevent workspace wipe on every deployment
```

### What Now Persists
✅ User-created files (any files in workspace)
✅ `.env` files with API keys
✅ Test files
✅ Modified configuration files
✅ Any files created through Claude Code
✅ `.claude` authentication folder

### Testing Procedure
1. Deploy to Render
2. Create test file: `/workspace/test1.md`
3. Create `.env`: `/workspace/tools/config/.env` with API key
4. Trigger redeployment
5. Verify files still exist
6. Verify `.env` API key still works

## Configuration Details

### Docker Configuration
**File:** `Dockerfile`

```dockerfile
# Line 18: Workspace directory (will be mounted by Render)
RUN mkdir -p /workspace

# Line 66: Workspace directory environment variable
ENV WORKSPACE_DIR=/workspace

# Line 78: Run init script on startup
CMD ["/bin/bash", "-c", "/app/scripts/init-workspace.sh && node /app/lib/claude-webui-server/dist/cli/node.js --port 10000 --host 0.0.0.0"]
```

### Render Configuration
**File:** `render.yaml`

```yaml
# Persistent disk for workspace files
disk:
  name: workspace
  mountPath: /workspace
  sizeGB: 10
```

## Technical Notes

### Permission State Management
The fix changes the semantic meaning of "temporary" permissions - they now persist in state for the duration of the session. The distinction between temporary and permanent permissions is now:
- **Temporary:** Can be manually cleared (no mechanism currently exists)
- **Permanent:** Same behavior as temporary

Future improvement could implement true temporary permissions that clear after each successful request.

### Workspace Initialization Pattern
The marker file pattern (checking for `CLAUDE.md`) is a common approach for Docker persistent storage:
1. Simple and reliable
2. No complex state management needed
3. Clear first-run vs subsequent-run logic
4. Easy to debug (just check if marker exists)

### Why This Happened
1. **Permission bug:** Mixed React state with local variables, assumed variables would survive async operations
2. **Workspace bug:** Temporary testing code left in production, lacked proper initialization guards

---

## Lessons Learned

### Development Best Practices
1. **Never** leave "TEMPORARY" code in production
2. **Always** test on target platform (mobile in this case)
3. **Always** add conditional guards for initialization scripts
4. **Never** use destructive commands without conditions in production

### Testing Improvements Needed
1. Mobile browser testing before deployment
2. Persistent disk testing (create → redeploy → verify)
3. State management testing across different browsers
4. Async timing testing on slower devices
