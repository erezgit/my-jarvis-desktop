# Ticket 007: ✅ COMPLETE

## Summary
File tree Claude spacing bug has been resolved. The terminal size synchronization issue was fixed by forcing an initial resize after PTY connection to ensure both xterm.js and node-pty agree on dimensions.

## Resolution
- Fixed PTY/xterm.js dimension mismatch (was hardcoded 80×30 vs actual container size)
- Implemented forced initial resize to sync dimensions
- Claude TUI now renders perfectly without manual window resize
