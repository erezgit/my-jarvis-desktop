# Ticket #041: MDX TicketStack Component for Visual Planning

## Summary
Created an interactive TicketStack React component for MDX files that displays tickets as beautiful, collapsible cards with visual progress tracking. This solves the cognitive overload problem of scrolling through long documentation files by providing a dashboard-like view of multiple tickets in a single screen.

## Problem Statement
- Difficulty capturing current state when looking at long documents
- Need to scroll endlessly through implementation plans
- Want to see 3-5 tickets at a glance with high-level product requirements, architecture, and implementation progress
- Sequential work pattern needs better visual representation than Kanban boards

## Solution Implemented

### TicketStack Component Created
**Location**: `/app/components/FilePreview/mdx/mdx-components/TicketStack.tsx`

**Features**:
- Full-width cards stacked vertically (perfect for sequential work)
- Color-coded status indicators (green for active, blue for planned, gray for completed)
- Collapsible sections for:
  - Product Requirements
  - Architecture decisions
  - Implementation tasks (with checkboxes)
- Visual progress bar showing completion percentage
- Confidence score display
- Next Action highlight box
- Theme-aware design (light/dark mode support)
- Clean, minimal aesthetic matching app design

### Component Data Structure
```typescript
interface Ticket {
  id: string;
  title: string;
  status: 'active' | 'planned' | 'completed';
  confidence: number;
  productRequirements: string;
  architecture: string;
  implementation: TicketTask[];
  nextAction: string;
}
```

### Integration Steps Completed
1. Created TicketStack.tsx component with full implementation
2. Exported component in `/app/components/FilePreview/mdx/mdx-components/index.ts`
3. Imported and registered in MDXRenderer.tsx
4. Created sample `/Users/erezfern/Workspace/my-jarvis/roadmap.mdx` demonstrating usage

### Sample Usage in MDX
```mdx
<TicketStack tickets={[
  {
    id: "041",
    title: "Workspace Switching & Onboarding System",
    status: "planned",
    confidence: 7,
    productRequirements: "Enable seamless workspace switching...",
    architecture: "Workspace registry in user config...",
    implementation: [
      { name: "Design workspace data model", done: false },
      { name: "Create workspace switcher UI", done: false }
    ],
    nextAction: "Design workspace data model and create schema"
  }
]} />
```

## Technical Details

### File Changes
- Created: `/app/components/FilePreview/mdx/mdx-components/TicketStack.tsx` (290 lines)
- Modified: `/app/components/FilePreview/mdx/mdx-components/index.ts`
- Modified: `/app/components/FilePreview/mdx/MDXRenderer.tsx`
- Created: `/Users/erezfern/Workspace/my-jarvis/roadmap.mdx` (example usage)

### Design Decisions
- Vertical stack layout instead of Kanban (matches sequential work pattern)
- Collapsible sections with smart defaults (implementation expanded, others collapsed)
- Single-screen focus (each card sized to minimize scrolling)
- Status-based color coding for quick visual scanning
- Prominent next action and progress indicators

## Next Steps
1. **Build production version** - Required to test new React component in MDX files
2. **Test in real usage** - Open roadmap.mdx in the app after rebuild
3. **Iterate on design** - Based on actual usage feedback
4. **Create more components**:
   - Calendar component for work planning
   - Timeline component for sequential progress
   - StatusDashboard for single-screen project overview

## Status
