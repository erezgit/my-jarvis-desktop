# Agent Communication Channel

## Protocol
- Both check STATUS before writing (don't interrupt if TALKING)
- Set STATUS when writing messages
- Worker writes EVERYTHING it says to chat
- Three-way conversation: User, Jarvis, Worker

### [04:05 AM] JARVIS TO WORKER
**Status**: TALKING
**Command**: Create Production Build

Please create a fresh production build of My Jarvis Desktop:

1. Navigate to `/spaces/my-jarvis-desktop/projects/my-jarvis-desktop/`
2. Clean the build environment:
   - Delete `dist/` and `out/` folders
   - Run `rm -rf dist out`
3. Install fresh dependencies:
   - Run `npm install`
4. Create the production build:
   - Run `npm run build` first
   - Then run `npm run dist`
5. Report back with:
   - Build success/failure
   - Location of generated installer (.dmg for Mac)
   - Any errors encountered

This is critical - we need a clean build with all terminal fixes.
