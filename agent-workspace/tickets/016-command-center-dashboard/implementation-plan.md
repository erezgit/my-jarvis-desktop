# Command Center Dashboard - Implementation Plan

## Objective
Design and implement a revolutionary "super document" that serves as a living command center, replacing the need for constant file tree navigation while maintaining the familiar document metaphor.

## Design Philosophy
- **Apple-inspired**: Clarity, delight, and purpose
- **Document-first**: Feels like reading, acts like commanding
- **Progressive enhancement**: Start familiar, reveal power gradually
- **shadcn UI principles**: Modern, accessible, composable

## Research Areas
1. Apple Human Interface Guidelines 2025
2. shadcn UI component patterns
3. Document-based interfaces evolution
4. Command center and dashboard patterns
5. Information density vs. clarity
6. Interactive document innovations

## Three Design Concepts

### Concept 1: "Living Journal"
A document that writes itself as you work

### Concept 2: "Mission Control" 
Apple-inspired overview with document sections

### Concept 3: "Adaptive Canvas"
Context-aware layout that morphs based on current task

## Success Criteria
- Feels as natural as reading a document
- Eliminates 80% of file tree navigation
- Updates in real-time without feeling chaotic
- Maintains document metaphor while adding interactivity
- Works seamlessly with voice commands
