## Current Working Context

### üéØ Primary Mission
Building the revolutionary command center dashboard that replaces file tree navigation with a living, breathing document interface.

### üìã Active Ticket: #016
**Command Center Dashboard Implementation**

We're creating three distinct approaches:
1. **Living Journal** ‚Üê *You are here*
2. Mission Control (Apple-inspired)
3. Adaptive Canvas (AI-powered)

### üîß Development Environment
<AgentStatus

## Philosophy: The Self-Writing Document

This Living Journal represents a new paradigm: **documents that understand context and write themselves**. 

Instead of navigating between files, the document becomes your command center. It knows:
- What you're working on right now
- Which files you've modified
- Your current development context
- Your progress toward goals

### Key Principles

1. **Document-First**: Feels like reading a journal, not using software
2. **Context-Aware**: Updates automatically based on your work
3. **Progressive Disclosure**: More detail available on demand
4. **Voice-Integrated**: Works seamlessly with Jarvis voice commands

### The Magic

Watch as this document evolves throughout your session:
- Task completion automatically updates progress bars
- File modifications appear in the activity stream
- Current context shifts based on what you're working on
- New sections emerge as needed

## Development Notes

### Technical Implementation
This Living Journal is built using:
- **MDX** for interactive React components in markdown
- **Real-time updates** via file system watchers
- **shadcn UI components** for consistent design
- **Apple-inspired typography** with clear hierarchy

### Voice Command Integration
```
"Jarvis, update my focus"
"Jarvis, show me recent files"
"Jarvis, what's my progress today?"
"Jarvis, open the current ticket"
```

### Next Steps
- [ ] Implement real-time file modification tracking
- [ ] Add voice command integration
- [ ] Create template system for different project types
- [ ] Build AI-powered content generation

## Reflection

This Living Journal concept transforms the traditional file explorer into something more intimate and intelligent. It's not just showing you where files are - it's understanding your workflow and becoming a partner in your creative process.

The document metaphor feels familiar and safe, but the underlying intelligence makes it powerful beyond traditional text editors. It's the perfect bridge between the comfort of documents and the power of modern interfaces.
