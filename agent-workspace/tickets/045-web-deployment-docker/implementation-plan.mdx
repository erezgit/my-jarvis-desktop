    productRequirements: `Enable access to My Jarvis Desktop from mobile devices and any browser without duplicating code.

Key User Stories:
- As a user, I want to access My Jarvis from my phone when away from my desktop
- As a user, I want the same features and interface whether on desktop or web
- As a developer, I want to maintain one codebase for both desktop and web deployments

Success Criteria:
- URL accessible from mobile browser shows full My Jarvis interface
- Claude Agent SDK works correctly in cloud environment with authentication
- File operations persist across deployments using Render persistent disk
- Desktop and web versions share 100% of React and backend code`,

    architecture: `Deployment Strategy: Monorepo with Conditional Packaging

Same Source Code, Different Packaging:
- Desktop: Electron → DMG (uses local Claude CLI authentication)
- Web: Docker → Container (needs authentication method for Claude API)

Environment Variables:
- VITE_WORKING_DIRECTORY=/workspace (sets default workspace in Docker)
- VITE_API_URL='' (empty = same origin for web)
- ANTHROPIC_API_KEY (required for Claude CLI in container)`,

## ✅ DEPLOYMENT COMPLETE - October 4, 2025

### What Works ✅
1. **Docker Container**: Builds and runs successfully on Render
2. **Frontend**: React app loads with full styling (Tailwind v4)
3. **File Tree**: Displays workspace files correctly
4. **Working Directory**: SDK receives `cwd: "/workspace"` correctly
5. **Claude CLI**: Authenticated and working at `/usr/local/bin/claude`
6. **API Routing**: Frontend correctly routes to backend via relative URLs
7. **Claude Agent**: Full conversation functionality verified on mobile

### Final Solution: Interactive Login with Persistent Disk ✅

**Authentication Method**: Used `claude login` in Render shell with persistent disk

**Setup Steps**:
1. Added Render persistent disk mounted at `/root/.claude`
2. Opened Render web shell
3. Ran `claude login` and completed interactive authentication
4. Credentials now persist across deployments

**Why This Works**:
- Claude CLI stores auth tokens in `~/.claude/` directory
- Render persistent disk keeps this directory across container restarts
- Server process inherits authentication from persistent directory
- Uses existing Claude subscription (no API key costs)

## Implementation Log

**Session 1: Initial Docker Setup**
1. Created Dockerfile, copied workspace files → ✅
2. Fixed React build (electron-vite → vite.web.config.ts) → ✅
3. Fixed static file serving path → ✅
4. Installed Claude CLI globally → ✅
5. Added VITE_WORKING_DIRECTORY env var → ✅
6. Fixed migrateLegacySettings to include workingDirectory → ✅
7. Changed executable from process.execPath to "node" → ✅

**Session 2: Render Deployment & Fixes**
1. Pushed to GitHub, Render auto-deployed → ✅
2. **Issue**: Tailwind styling not working in production
3. **Cause**: vite.web.config.ts not compatible with ESM-only Tailwind v4
4. **Fix**: Renamed to vite.web.config.mts to force ESM mode → ✅
5. **Issue**: Frontend trying to call localhost instead of Render backend
6. **Cause**: Hardcoded `http://127.0.0.1:8081` in API config
7. **Fix**: Made API URLs conditional - relative for web, absolute for Electron → ✅
8. **Issue**: "Invalid API key" after authentication
9. **Cause**: Ephemeral file system - credentials lost on redeploy
10. **Fix**: Added Render persistent disk at `/root/.claude` → ✅
11. Ran `claude login` in Render shell → ✅
12. **SUCCESS**: Full functionality verified on mobile → ✅

## Files Modified

1. **Dockerfile**:
   - Added `ENV VITE_WORKING_DIRECTORY=/workspace`
   - Added `mkdir -p /root/.claude` for persistent auth
   - Generate version.ts during build

2. **vite.web.config.mts** (renamed from .ts):
   - Force ESM mode for Tailwind v4 compatibility
   - Restored `@tailwindcss/vite` plugin

3. **app/config/api.ts**:
   - Detect Electron vs web mode
   - Use relative URLs in web, absolute in Electron

4. **app/types/settings.ts**:
   - Use `import.meta.env.VITE_WORKING_DIRECTORY`

5. **app/utils/storage.ts**:
   - Include `workingDirectory` in migration

6. **lib/claude-webui-server/handlers/chat.ts**:
   - Changed `executable: "node"`

## Deployment Configuration

**Render Settings**:
- Plan: Starter ($7/month, 512MB RAM)
- Runtime: Docker
- Auto-deploy: Enabled (on git push)
- Persistent Disk: 1GB mounted at `/root/.claude`

## Known Limitations

1. **Voice generation**: Not yet tested in production
2. **File operations**: Write operations work in `/workspace` (ephemeral)
3. **Performance**: 512MB RAM may be limiting for large conversations
