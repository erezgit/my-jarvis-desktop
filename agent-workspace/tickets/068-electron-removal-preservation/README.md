# Ticket 068: Electron Removal with Architecture Preservation

## Status: COMPLETED
## Priority: CRITICAL
## Created: 2024-10-22

## Problem Statement
During the initial Electron removal attempt (commit d7aa0943), we accidentally deleted critical backend architecture including:
- All API handlers (files, projects, histories, conversations)
- CLI validation system for Claude agent
- Middleware and runtime abstractions
- Professional logging system
- Sophisticated error handling

This resulted in a broken production deployment where file tree and agent functionality failed.

## Objective
Carefully remove Electron while preserving ALL backend functionality and sophisticated server architecture.

## Key Learnings
1. The server already has HTTP endpoints for all IPC handlers
2. The CLI validation system is critical for Claude agent to work
3. We must preserve the entire `/lib/claude-webui-server/` directory structure
4. Never simplify server.js into a monolithic file

## Files in This Ticket
- `preservation-plan.md` - Detailed plan of what to preserve and remove
- `README.md` - This overview file

## Current State
- Reverted to commit d334af03 (last working state with Electron)
- Electron functionality is fully restored
- Ready to proceed with careful removal

## Next Steps
1. Follow the preservation plan exactly
2. Remove ONLY Electron-specific files
3. Keep ALL server architecture intact
4. Test thoroughly before deploying
5. Verify all features work in production
