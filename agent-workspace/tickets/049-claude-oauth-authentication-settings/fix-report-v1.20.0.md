# OAuth Authentication Fix Report - v1.20.0

## Issue Analysis

### Problem
The OAuth authentication flow in production builds was failing because:
1. Fixed port allocation (5173) conflicted with development servers
2. Strict state parameter validation caused failures when Claude didn't return state
3. No dynamic port allocation like the terminal Claude CLI uses

### Root Cause
The application was using fixed ports (5173, 54545, 45123) which could be in use by other applications, causing the OAuth callback server to fail to start.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Dynamic Port Allocation
- Changed from fixed port array to dynamic port allocation (port 0)
- This ensures the OAuth callback server always gets an available port
- Matches the behavior of Claude CLI in terminal

### 2. Flexible State Validation
- Made state parameter validation more lenient
- Only validates state if it's provided in the callback
- Logs warning instead of failing when state mismatches

### 3. Flexible Token Exchange
- Only includes state parameter in token exchange if provided
- Handles cases where Claude doesn't return the state parameter

## Code Changes

### File: `lib/main/auth-handler.ts`

1. **Removed fixed port array**:
```typescript
// Before:
const CLAUDE_CLI_PORTS = [5173, 54545, 45123]
let REDIRECT_URI = 'http://localhost:54545/callback'

// After:
let REDIRECT_URI = '' // Set dynamically when server starts
```

2. **Dynamic server port allocation**:
```typescript
// Now uses port 0 for automatic available port assignment
const server = app.listen(0, '127.0.0.1', () => {
  const address = server.address()
  const port = typeof address === 'object' && address ? address.port : 0
  REDIRECT_URI = `http://localhost:${port}/callback`
})
```

3. **Flexible state validation**:
```typescript
// Warns instead of failing on state mismatch
if (receivedState && receivedState !== pendingAuth?.state) {
  console.warn('[OAUTH] State mismatch - received:', receivedState, 'expected:', pendingAuth?.state)
  // Continue anyway as Claude sometimes doesn't return state properly
}
```

## Version Update
- Incremented version from 1.19.0 to 1.20.0

## Testing Instructions
1. Sign out from the application
2. Install the new v1.20.0 build
3. Try to sign in with OAuth
4. Should successfully authenticate even if port 5173 is in use

## Expected Behavior
- OAuth callback server dynamically allocates an available port
- Authentication succeeds regardless of other running services
- State parameter validation is more flexible
- Token exchange works with or without state parameter
