# Ticket #38: Auto-Refresh File Tree on File Creation

## Status: ✅ CLOSED - Production Tested Successfully

## Problem
When Claude created files through Write/Edit tools, the file tree didn't automatically refresh and the file preview didn't update. Users had to manually refresh to see new files.

## Root Cause Analysis
1. **Message Timing**: FileOperationMessage was created from `tool_result` (after file written), placed at messages[N-1], while ToolResultMessage was at messages[N]
2. **Detection Logic**: DesktopLayout only checked the last message, missing FileOperationMessage at N-1
3. **Tree Collapse**: Original refresh logic replaced entire items array, causing expanded directories to collapse
4. **Preview Not Loading**: Auto-select called without loading file content first

## Implementation

### Files Modified
- **app/types.ts**: Added FileOperationMessage interface
- **app/utils/UnifiedMessageProcessor.ts**: Detect Write/Edit tool results, create FileOperationMessage
- **app/contexts/ChatStateContext.tsx**: Shared state for cross-component coordination
- **app/contexts/ChatStateProvider.tsx**: Context provider wrapper
- **app/App.tsx**: Added ChatStateProvider
- **app/components/ChatPage.tsx**: Uses ChatStateContext
- **app/components/Layout/DesktopLayout.tsx**:
  - Track lastProcessedMessageCount
  - Search through new messages for FileOperationMessage
  - Trigger surgical refresh and auto-select with content loading
- **app/components/FileTree/VirtualizedFileTree.tsx**:
  - Added forwardRef and useImperativeHandle
  - Implemented surgical `refreshDirectoryContents()` method
  - Preserves tree state by updating only affected directory's children
- **app/components/messages/FileOperationComponent.tsx**: UI component for file operation messages
- **lib/main/app.ts**: Fixed dev environment URL loading (JARVIS_DEV_PORT)
- **package.json**: Added NODE_ENV=development to dev script

### Key Features
✅ Auto-detects file creation/modification from Write/Edit tool results
✅ Surgical directory refresh - no tree collapse
✅ Auto-selects newly created file
✅ Loads file content in preview panel
✅ Tracks processed messages to avoid re-processing
