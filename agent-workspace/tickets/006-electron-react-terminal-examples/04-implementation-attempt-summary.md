# Ticket 006: Implementation Attempt Summary

**Date**: September 8, 2025  
**Status**: ❌ FAILED - Class component conversion did not fix the issue

## What We Tried

### Research Phase
- Cloned and analyzed 3 major open source projects:
  - **Hyper Terminal** - Uses React.PureComponent with Redux
  - **Electerm** - Uses React.Component 
  - **Wave Terminal** - Separates terminal logic from React entirely

### Key Finding
All successful terminal implementations use **class components**, not functional components with hooks.

### Implementation Attempt
Converted `ProperTerminal.tsx` from functional component to class component:
- Used `React.PureComponent` (following Hyper's pattern)
- Removed all hooks (useEffect, useRef, useState)
- Moved terminal instance to class properties
- Used lifecycle methods (componentDidMount, componentWillUnmount)

### Result
**❌ FAILED** - The duplicate character issue persists even with class components.

## Conclusion

The problem is deeper than just React's component lifecycle. Even though all successful projects use class components, converting to a class component alone did not solve our terminal rendering issues.

## Possible Root Causes Still to Investigate

1. **CSS/Style conflicts** from the electron-react-app template
2. **Webpack/Vite configuration** issues
3. **Version mismatch** between xterm packages
4. **Electron IPC implementation** differences
5. **DOM mounting context** in our specific setup

## Files Modified
- `/app/components/ProperTerminal.tsx` - Converted to class component
- `/app/CleanApp.tsx` - Updated import

## Next Steps
The issue requires deeper investigation beyond just the React component pattern. Consider:
- Testing with the exact xterm version from CDN (5.3.0)
- Complete isolation approaches (iframe, web component)
- Different Electron boilerplate/template
- Examining the electron-react-app template for conflicts
