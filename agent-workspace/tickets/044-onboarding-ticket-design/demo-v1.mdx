## Design Notes

### Color Progression Logic
The overall progress color smoothly transitions based on completion:
```
0%: Red (#EF4444)
1-32%: Amber/Orange (#F59E0B)
33-65%: Blue (#3B82F6)
66-100%: Green (#10B981)
```

### Task State Colors
- **Green**: Task completed âœ“
- **Blue**: Current active task (currentStep)
- **Red**: Not started tasks

### Visual Enhancements
- Circular SVG progress ring with smooth animation
- Confidence blocks that fill with the current progress color
- Active task gets scale transform + glow shadow
- Gradient header background tints with progress color
- Status indicators with colored dots

This creates a **strong visual hierarchy** and makes progress immediately clear at a glance.
