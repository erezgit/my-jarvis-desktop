## Design Notes

### Journey Metaphor
The design uses a **vertical journey path** that connects all tasks:
- Gradient-colored line showing progress direction
- Each task is a **milestone** along the journey
- Status circles have border rings on the active task
- Completion brings a celebratory finish message

### Icon System
**Status Icons:**
- ✅ Green: Task completed
- 🔵 Blue: Current active task
- ⚪ Gray: Not started

**Task Icons:**
- Each task has a unique emoji representing its purpose
- Icons are slightly grayed out when not complete
- Helps with quick visual scanning

### Visual Flow
1. **Header** with rocket emoji and gradient background
2. **Progress tracker** showing emoji sequence
3. **Journey path** with connected milestones
4. **Completion message** appears when all done

### Animation Details
- Active task milestone scales up + gets ring border
- Hover on any status icon scales it up 125%
- Completed tasks show bounce animation 🎉
- Smooth transitions between states

This design tells a **visual story** and makes onboarding feel like an exciting journey rather than a checklist.
