# Ticket #046: Parallel Agent Orchestration for My Jarvis Desktop

**Status**: üü° Solution Identified
**Priority**: High
**Created**: 2025-10-04
**Confidence**: 8/10 (Clear implementation path with Claude Agent SDK)

## ‚úÖ SOLUTION: Custom Orchestrator with Claude Agent SDK

After extensive research (10+ searches), the Claude Agent SDK provides all the building blocks we need for parallel, non-blocking agent execution.

### IMPORTANT: No New Services Required

**You do NOT need to run multiple Node services**. Here's what actually happens:

**Option 1 - Child Processes**:
- Your existing backend server (port 8081) spawns temporary child processes
- Like opening new terminal tabs programmatically
- Workers run, complete their task, and terminate
- NOT permanent services, just temporary workers

**Option 2 - In-Process Agents**:
- Even simpler - multiple ClaudeAgentClient instances in your SAME backend
- Run in parallel using async operations
- No new processes at all, just concurrent agent objects

**The Architecture**:
```
Your My Jarvis Desktop Backend (port 8081) - ALWAYS RUNNING
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Main Chat Handler (you talk to me here)
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ AgentOrchestrator
        ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Spawns temporary workers when needed
        ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Workers do their job and disappear
        ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Results sent back via IPC/callbacks
```

You still have **ONE backend server**. That server orchestrates temporary agent instances as needed. No port management, no service complexity, just your main server managing workers.

### How We Can Achieve Our Goal

**Your Requirements**:
1. Keep talking while agents work in background
2. Deploy new Claude instances with initial prompts
3. Give agents access to files
4. Maintain communication between agents

**Implementation Architecture**:

```typescript
// My Jarvis Desktop Backend (lib/claude-webui-server)
import { ClaudeAgentClient } from '@anthropic-ai/claude-agent-sdk';
import { spawn } from 'child_process';

class AgentOrchestrator {
  private agents: Map<string, AgentInstance> = new Map();

  async spawnAgent(prompt: string, workDir: string) {
    // Option 1: In-process agent (faster, shares memory)
    const agent = new ClaudeAgentClient({
      system_prompt: prompt,
      cwd: workDir,
      allowed_tools: ["Read", "Write", "Bash"]
    });

    // Option 2: Subprocess agent (isolated, parallel)
    const agentProcess = spawn('node', ['agent-worker.js'], {
      env: { INITIAL_PROMPT: prompt, WORK_DIR: workDir }
    });

    // Store reference for communication
    this.agents.set(agentId, { agent, process: agentProcess });

    // Non-blocking - returns immediately
    return agentId;
  }

  // Called by your UnifiedMessageProcessor
  async checkAgentStatus(agentId: string) {
    // Returns results without blocking main chat
  }
}
```

### Key Discoveries from Research

1. **Multiple ClaudeSDKClient Instances**: Create separate SDK clients, each is independent
2. **No Built-in Multi-Agent**: SDK doesn't have native multi-agent, but we can build it
3. **Session Forking**: 10-20x faster spawning with session forking (750ms vs 7500ms)
4. **In-Process vs Subprocess**: Can run agents in same process (fast) or subprocess (isolated)
5. **Communication Options**: File-based, WebSocket, IPC, or shared memory

### Proven Examples We Can Adapt

**Claude Code Agent Farm** (runs 50+ agents):
- Uses tmux sessions for isolation
- Central coordination directory
- Lock files to prevent conflicts
- Work queue distribution

**Claude Code by Agents** (multi-agent orchestration):
- HTTP endpoints for each agent
- Orchestrator routes tasks via @mentions
- File-based coordination
- Remote agent support

**Our Simplified Approach**:
- Spawn agents via SDK in Node child processes
- IPC for agent-to-main communication
- WebSocket to frontend for real-time updates
- No file pollution in user projects

### Implementation Steps

1. **Backend Enhancement** (`lib/claude-webui-server`):
   ```typescript
   // Add orchestration endpoint
   app.post('/agents/spawn', async (req, res) => {
     const { prompt, workDir } = req.body;
     const agentId = await orchestrator.spawnAgent(prompt, workDir);
     res.json({ agentId, status: 'running' });
   });

   // WebSocket for real-time updates
   ws.on('connection', (socket) => {
     orchestrator.on('agent-update', (data) => {
       socket.send(JSON.stringify(data));
     });
   });
   ```

2. **Agent Worker Script** (`agent-worker.js`):
   ```javascript
   const { ClaudeAgentClient } = require('@anthropic-ai/claude-agent-sdk');

   const agent = new ClaudeAgentClient({
     system_prompt: process.env.INITIAL_PROMPT,
     cwd: process.env.WORK_DIR
   });

   // Send updates to parent
   process.send({ type: 'status', message: 'Working...' });

   // Execute task
   const results = await agent.query(process.env.INITIAL_PROMPT);
   process.send({ type: 'complete', results });
   ```

3. **Frontend Integration**:
   - Add UI for spawned agents status
   - WebSocket connection for real-time updates
   - Non-blocking - chat continues normally

### Why This Works

‚úÖ **No Blocking**: Agents run in separate processes/threads
‚úÖ **Full File Access**: Each agent has working directory access
‚úÖ **Clean Projects**: No .swarm or contamination
‚úÖ **Scalable**: Run 10+ agents simultaneously
‚úÖ **Communication**: IPC + WebSocket for real-time coordination
‚úÖ **SDK Power**: Leverage Claude Agent SDK capabilities

### Next Actions

1. [ ] Install `@anthropic-ai/claude-agent-sdk` in backend
2. [ ] Create `AgentOrchestrator` class
3. [ ] Implement agent worker script
4. [ ] Add WebSocket support
5. [ ] Test with 3 parallel agents
6. [ ] Add UI for agent monitoring

## ‚ö†Ô∏è UPDATE: Control Room Pattern Won't Work

After analyzing Claude Flow's source code, the "control room" hypothesis is **INVALID**.

### Critical Findings from Code Analysis

**Claude Flow uses `getProjectRoot()`** which:
1. Actively searches UP the directory tree for project markers
2. Looks for: `package.json`, `.git`, existing `.swarm`, or `CLAUDE.md`
3. Creates `.swarm` in the **project root it finds**, not launch location

**GitHub Issue #765 confirms**:
- Agents were creating duplicate `.swarm` folders in subdirectories
- The fix ensures ALL agents find and use the SAME project root
- This makes it WORSE for isolation - guarantees `.swarm` in user's project

**Why Control Room Fails**:
- If launched from `~/jarvis-orchestration/`: Creates `.swarm` there initially
- When operating on user project: Detects project markers, creates ANOTHER `.swarm` in user's project
- Result: File contamination still occurs in user's project directory

### Validated Options After Code Analysis

#### Option 1: Accept Claude Flow's Design
- **Reality**: `.swarm` directory WILL be created in user projects
- **Solution**: Add to `.gitignore`, document for users
- **Pros**: Full swarm capabilities, works as designed
- **Cons**: Visible file pollution users must accept

#### Option 2: Custom Orchestration Layer
- Build our own parallel agent system
- Use Claude Agent SDK directly
- Complete control over file locations
- **Pros**: No contamination, full control
- **Cons**: Significant development effort

#### Option 3: Alternative Tools
- Investigate Claude Code Agentrooms
- Explore container-based isolation
- Consider other orchestration platforms
- **Pros**: May offer better isolation
- **Cons**: Need to evaluate each option

## Problem Statement
Need to implement true parallel, non-blocking agent execution in My Jarvis Desktop. Currently, the Task tool with subagents blocks the main conversation, preventing continuous interaction while agents work in background.

## Research Findings

### Claude Flow Assessment (Score: 3/10)
After thorough documentation review, Claude Flow is **NOT suitable** for our isolation requirements:

1. **Not an MCP Server**: Claude Flow is a CLI tool that extends Claude Code, not a separate service
2. **Intentional File Creation**: Creates `.swarm/` directory with memory.db in project root (by design)
3. **Not Isolated**: Runs alongside Claude Code in the same workspace
4. **MCP Consumer, Not Provider**: Uses 87 MCP tools but doesn't expose MCP endpoints

### Current Limitations
- Task tool subagents block main conversation
- No native non-blocking parallel execution in Claude Code
- Feature Request #3013 still open on GitHub

### Available Options

#### 1. Background Bash Processes (Partial Solution)
- ‚úÖ Non-blocking for processes
- ‚úÖ Already available via `run_in_background: true`
- ‚ùå Limited to shell commands, not full agents

#### 2. Multiple Terminal Sessions
- ‚úÖ True parallel execution
- ‚úÖ User already has experience with this
- ‚ùå Manual coordination required
- ‚ùå No automated orchestration

#### 3. File-Based Coordination (Previous Attempt)
- ‚úÖ Worked to some extent
- ‚ùå Required continuous polling loops
- ‚ùå Complex coordination logic

#### 4. Claude Agent SDK Custom Implementation
- ‚úÖ Full control over orchestration
- ‚úÖ Can build true MCP server
- ‚ùå Significant development effort
- ‚ùå Requires deep SDK knowledge

## Proposed Solution

### Option A: Enhanced File-Based Coordination
Build on the user's previous file-based approach with improvements:
- Use WebSocket or IPC instead of file polling
- Implement proper message queue (Redis or SQLite)
- Create coordination service in Electron main process

### Option B: Custom MCP Server
Build a lightweight MCP server specifically for My Jarvis Desktop:
- Separate Node.js service for agent orchestration
- Clean MCP protocol implementation
- No file contamination in project
- Manages agent lifecycle and communication

### Option C: Embrace Claude Flow Architecture
Accept the `.swarm/` directory approach:
- Use Claude Flow as designed
- Configure `.gitignore` for swarm files
- Benefit from built-in orchestration features

## Technical Requirements

### For Custom MCP Server (Option B)
1. **Server Component**
   - Express/Hono server on separate port
   - MCP protocol implementation
   - Agent spawn and lifecycle management
   - Message routing and queuing

2. **Integration with My Jarvis Desktop**
   - Modify UnifiedMessageProcessor for orchestration messages
   - Add MCP client to backend server
   - Handle streaming responses from parallel agents

3. **Isolation Requirements**
   - Run in separate directory (e.g., `~/jarvis-orchestrator/`)
   - No file writes to project directory
   - Communication only via API/MCP protocol

## Implementation Steps

### Phase 1: Research & Prototype
- [ ] Investigate Claude Agent SDK orchestration capabilities
- [ ] Prototype simple MCP server
- [ ] Test WebSocket-based coordination

### Phase 2: Architecture Decision
- [ ] Evaluate prototypes
- [ ] Choose approach (A, B, or C)
- [ ] Design detailed architecture

### Phase 3: Implementation

- [ ] Add error recovery

## Success Criteria
- Non-blocking parallel agent execution
- Clean project directory (no contamination)
- Seamless integration with existing chat interface
- Real-time progress updates from parallel agents
- Ability to run 4+ agents simultaneously

## Alternative Approaches to Consider

### 1. **Claude Code Agentrooms**
- Desktop app for multi-agent orchestration
- Uses @mentions for agent routing
- Worth investigating further

### 2. **Git Worktrees Method**
- Multiple Claude sessions on different branches
- Clean separation of work
- Manual but effective

### 3. **Container-Based Isolation**
- Run agents in Docker containers
- Complete filesystem isolation
- Higher complexity but total control
