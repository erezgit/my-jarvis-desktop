### [04:53 AM] JARVIS TO WORKER
**Status**: TALKING

Desktop Worker, I need you to analyze the current terminal architecture in the My Jarvis Desktop application and design options for adding multi-terminal support.

**Your Tasks:**
1. Analyze the current terminal implementation:
   - Review files in `/Users/erezfern/Workspace/jarvis/spaces/my-jarvis-desktop/projects/my-jarvis-desktop/`
   - Focus on: `app/components/Terminal.tsx`, `ProperTerminal.tsx`, `WorkingTerminal.tsx`
   - Check the conveyor API: `lib/conveyor/api/terminal-api.ts` and handlers
   
2. Understand the architecture:
   - How is the terminal currently instantiated?
   - What's the component hierarchy?
   - How does terminal-handler.ts manage the PTY?
   - How does the IPC communication work?

3. Design clean options for multi-terminal:
   - Option 1: Tab-based terminals (like VS Code)
   - Option 2: Split pane terminals (tmux style)
   - Option 3: Floating terminal windows
   - Consider: How to manage multiple PTY instances
   - Consider: UI/UX for switching between terminals
   - Consider: Resource management and cleanup

4. Identify the minimal changes needed:
   - What components need modification?
   - Does the backend handler need to manage multiple PTYs?
   - How to handle IPC for multiple terminals?
   - State management considerations

Please do thorough analysis and report back with:
- Current architecture summary
- At least 2-3 implementation options
- Pros/cons of each approach
- Your recommended approach with reasoning

**Status**: TALKING
**Task Status**: WORKING

Acknowledged. Beginning analysis of terminal architecture for multi-terminal support.

Starting with current implementation review...

## ANALYSIS COMPLETE

### Current Terminal Architecture Summary

**Component Structure:**
1. **Frontend Components:**
   - `Terminal.tsx` - Base terminal component using XTerm.js
   - `ProperTerminal.tsx` - Enhanced terminal with tab UI
   - `WorkingTerminal.tsx` - Simplified terminal implementation
   - Single terminal instance per app (`id="main-terminal"`)

2. **IPC Communication:**
   - `TerminalApi` class handles frontend API calls
   - Uses conveyor pattern: `terminal:create`, `terminal:write`, `terminal:resize`, etc.
   - Event-based data flow: `terminal:data:${id}`, `terminal:exit:${id}`

3. **Backend Handler:**
   - `terminal-handler.ts` manages PTY instances
   - Stores terminals in object: `terminals[id] = ptyProcess`
   - Each terminal has unique ID for routing
   - Handles create/destroy/write/resize operations

4. **Current Limitations:**
   - Only one terminal rendered in UI (hardcoded in app.tsx)
   - No UI for managing multiple terminals
   - Backend supports multiple PTYs but frontend doesn't utilize it

### IMPLEMENTATION OPTIONS

## Option 1: Tab-Based Terminal System
**Description:** Add tabs above terminal area, each tab = separate terminal

**Implementation:**
- New `MultiTerminal.tsx` component with tab management
- Array of terminal states: `[{id, name, active}]`
- Render single Terminal component, switch based on active tab
- Add/close buttons in tab bar

**Pros:**
- Familiar UI pattern (VS Code style)
- Minimal screen space usage
- Simple state management
- Easy to implement with existing architecture

**Cons:**
- Can only see one terminal at a time
- No visual comparison between terminals
- Tab switching might feel slow with many terminals

## Option 2: Split Pane Terminal System  
**Description:** Divide terminal area into resizable panes (tmux/iTerm style)

**Implementation:**
- New `SplitTerminal.tsx` with recursive pane structure
- Tree structure for splits: `{type: 'horizontal'|'vertical', children: []}`
- Each leaf node renders Terminal component
- Use ResizablePanel components for splits

**Pros:**
- View multiple terminals simultaneously
- Power user friendly
- Flexible layouts (horizontal/vertical splits)
- Good for monitoring multiple processes

**Cons:**
- Complex implementation (recursive rendering)
- Screen space gets cramped with many terminals
- More complex state management
- Might overwhelm casual users

## Option 3: Floating Terminal Windows
**Description:** Terminals as draggable, resizable floating panels

**Implementation:**
- New `FloatingTerminal.tsx` wrapper with drag/resize
- Z-index management for window stacking
- Minimize/maximize controls per terminal
- Optional dock/undock functionality

**Pros:**
- Maximum flexibility
- Can position terminals anywhere
- Easy to minimize unused terminals
- Good for multi-monitor setups

**Cons:**
- Can clutter the interface
- Window management overhead
- Not ideal for small screens
- More complex interaction patterns

### RECOMMENDED APPROACH

**Recommendation: Option 1 (Tab-Based) with future Option 2 support**

**Reasoning:**
1. **Immediate value** - Tabs are simple to implement and understand
2. **Backend ready** - Current handler already supports multiple PTYs
3. **Minimal changes** - Can reuse existing Terminal component
4. **Progressive enhancement** - Can add split pane as "advanced mode" later
5. **User familiarity** - Most devs know VS Code terminal tabs

**Implementation Path:**
1. Create `MultiTerminal.tsx` with tab UI
2. Add terminal management state (add/remove/switch)
3. Update app.tsx to use MultiTerminal
4. Add keyboard shortcuts (Cmd+T new, Cmd+W close)
5. Store terminal sessions in localStorage
6. Later: Add split pane view as optional mode

**Minimal Changes Needed:**
- New component: `MultiTerminal.tsx` (~150 lines)
- Update: `app.tsx` to use MultiTerminal
- No backend changes required (already supports multiple)
- Add tab UI components (can use existing UI library)

### [04:59 AM] JARVIS TO WORKER
**Status**: TALKING

Perfect analysis! However, Erez wants something specific and simpler:

**Requirements:**
- Two terminals side-by-side (not tabs)
- Resizable width between them (like current file tree/terminal split)
- That's it for now - just two terminals, cleanly implemented

Think of it like this:
```
[Terminal 1] | [Terminal 2]
             ^ draggable divider
```

Similar to how we currently have:
```
[File Tree] | [Terminal]
            ^ existing resizable divider
```

**Implementation approach:**
1. Modify the terminal area to show two Terminal components side-by-side
2. Use the same ResizablePanel pattern we're using for file tree
3. Each terminal gets its own PTY instance (terminal-1, terminal-2)
4. Both terminals always visible
5. Clean, simple, no tabs or complex UI

Please implement this specific two-terminal side-by-side layout. Keep it simple and consistent with the existing resizable panel approach.

**Task Status**: WORKING

Understood! Much simpler - just two terminals side-by-side with resizable divider.

Implementing the two-terminal layout now...

### IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE

Created a clean dual terminal implementation:

**New Component: `DualTerminal.tsx`**
- Uses ResizablePanelGroup for horizontal split
- Two ProperTerminal instances side-by-side
- Each terminal has unique ID: "terminal-left" and "terminal-right"
- Draggable divider between them (50/50 default split)
- Min 20%, max 80% width for each terminal
- Handles resize events for both terminals
- Theme updates propagate to both terminals

**Modified: `app.tsx`**
- Imported DualTerminal component
- Replaced single ProperTerminal with DualTerminal
- Maintains all existing functionality
- Comment updated: "Right Panel - Dual Terminals"

**Features:**
✓ Two terminals side-by-side
✓ Resizable width divider (consistent with file tree pattern)
✓ Each terminal gets its own PTY instance
✓ Both terminals always visible
✓ Clean and simple implementation
✓ No tabs or complex UI

The implementation is complete and ready to test. Both terminals will work independently with their own shell sessions.

### [05:04 AM] JARVIS TO WORKER
**Status**: TALKING

Excellent work on the implementation! Now we need to test it. Please:

1. **Create a production build** with a different version/name so we can run both apps in parallel
   - Update package.json to version 1.3.0 or add a suffix to the app name
   - This way we can test WITHOUT closing our current v1.2.0 session
   - Build should create a separate DMG/app that won't conflict

2. **Run the production build**:
   - `npm run build:mac` to create the DMG
   - The output should be distinguishable from v1.2.0
   
3. **Important**: We want to run BOTH versions simultaneously:
   - Current app (1.2.0) stays open with our conversation
   - New app (1.3.0) opens separately to test dual terminals
   - No conflict between the two instances

Please proceed with creating this parallel-testable build.
