## Current Status Summary

### What We Accomplished This Session

1. **Fixed Permission System Issues** ✅
   - Root cause: `bypassPermissions` mode blocked when running as root in Docker
   - Solution: Changed default permission mode to `acceptEdits` in `usePermissionMode.ts`
   - File: `/workspace/my-jarvis/projects/my-jarvis-desktop/app/hooks/chat/usePermissionMode.ts`
   - Result: Permission prompts eliminated, sessions no longer crash with exit code 1

2. **Upgraded my-jarvis-erez-dev Memory** ✅
   - Increased from 1GB to 2GB RAM
   - File: `/workspace/my-jarvis/projects/my-jarvis-desktop/fly.toml` (line 45)
   - Reason: PDF processing was exhausting available memory
   - Result: Instance no longer freezes during PDF viewing

3. **Identified Root Cause of Processing Hang** ✅
   - **Problem**: PDF processing completes successfully (34 chunks created), but Claude sessions hang when trying to read all chunks and formulate response
   - **Root Cause**: Fly.io's 60-second idle timeout for HTTP streaming connections
   - **Evidence**: Fly.io community forum documentation confirms: "That 60s timeout resets when you send any data at all"
   - **Why it happens**: When Claude reads 34 chunk files and thinks about response, NO data is sent over HTTP connection for >60 seconds
   - **Why local works**: No proxy between browser and localhost - direct connection never times out
   - **Why health check isn't the issue**: Health check runs independently every 15 seconds on `/health` endpoint

4. **Files Successfully Deployed** ✅
   - Knowledge base guide: `/workspace/my-jarvis/docs/knowledge-base-guide.md`
   - Processing script: `/workspace/tools/scripts/process_document.py`
   - Both files deployed via workspace-template initialization
   - Script location corrected from old path to new path in documentation

---

## Current Technical State

### Working Components
- ✅ PDF upload functionality
- ✅ PDF chunking script (creates 34 chunks for 48MB PDF)
- ✅ Chunk file creation in `/workspace/my-jarvis/knowledge-base/[document-name]/chunks/`
- ✅ Metadata JSON generation
- ✅ PDF viewer (React PDF Viewer) with 2GB RAM
- ✅ Permission system (acceptEdits mode)

### Identified Issue
- ❌ **Fly.io 60-second idle timeout kills HTTP streaming connections**
  - When: Claude reads multiple chunk files and formulates response
  - Duration: Takes >60 seconds with no data sent
  - Result: Connection terminated by Fly proxy
  - Frontend: Appears hung (no timeout configured on fetch call)
  - Backend: Session completes but response never reaches frontend

---

## Root Cause Analysis - Fly.io Timeout

### The Problem
```
User uploads PDF → Claude chunks it (works) → Claude reads 34 chunks
→ Claude thinks about response (60+ seconds, no data sent)
→ Fly.io proxy: "Connection idle for 60s, killing it"
→ Frontend still waiting (no client timeout)
→ User sees: Hung/stuck interface
```

### Evidence Sources
1. **Fly.io Community Forum**: "60-second timeout resets when you send any data"
2. **Session Logs**: `AbortError: Claude Code process aborted by user` (manual abort after hang)
3. **Ticket #065 Documentation**: Line 40 mentions "Fly.io load balancer/HTTP2 proxy hits connection timeout ~60-120s"
4. **Web Search Results**: Multiple users reporting 60s idle timeout for streaming connections

### Why Health Check Isn't the Issue
- Health check: Separate GET request to `/health` every 15 seconds
- Chat connections: Long-running POST to `/api/chat` with streaming body
- They are independent - health check passing doesn't affect chat timeout

### Key Configuration (fly.toml)
```toml
[[http_service.checks]]
  interval = "15s"      # How often to check
  timeout = "10s"       # How long to wait for /health response
  grace_period = "30s"  # Startup grace period
  method = "GET"
  path = "/health"
```
This checks if the **server** is alive, not individual request connections.

---

## Next Steps (Priority Order)

### 1. Implement Keep-Alive Mechanism (Critical)
**Problem**: Fly.io kills idle connections after 60 seconds
**Solution**: Send periodic progress messages every 30-40 seconds

**Implementation Options**:

#### Option A: Stream Progress Updates (Recommended)
- Modify chat handler to send progress events during long operations
- Example: `{ type: "progress", message: "Reading chunk 10/34..." }`
- Resets Fly timeout with each message
- Provides user feedback

#### Option B: Heartbeat Messages
- Send empty data chunks every 30 seconds
- Keeps connection alive
- Less informative for user

**Files to Modify**:
- `/workspace/my-jarvis/projects/my-jarvis-desktop/lib/claude-webui-server/handlers/chat.ts`
- Add progress streaming to `executeClaudeCommand` function
- Frontend: Handle new progress message type in `ChatPage.tsx`

### 2. Add Client-Side Timeout (Safety Net)
**Problem**: Frontend has NO timeout, waits indefinitely
**Solution**: Add AbortSignal with 3-minute timeout

**File**: `/workspace/my-jarvis/projects/my-jarvis-desktop/app/components/ChatPage.tsx`
**Location**: Line 184 (fetch call to getChatUrl())

```typescript
const controller = new AbortController();
const timeoutId = setTimeout(() => controller.abort(), 180000); // 3 minutes

const response = await fetch(getChatUrl(), {
  method: "POST",
  headers: { "Content-Type": "application/json" },
  body: JSON.stringify({...}),
  signal: controller.signal
});

clearTimeout(timeoutId);
```

### 3. Optimize Chunk Processing
**Current**: Claude reads all 34 chunks, then thinks
**Better**: Process chunks in batches, stream results

**Pseudocode**:
```
For each batch of 5 chunks:
  - Read chunks
  - Send progress: "Processing chunks 1-5..."
  - Analyze
  - Send partial result
```

This naturally keeps connection alive and provides incremental results.

## Technical Decisions Made

### Permission Mode: acceptEdits
- **Why**: Works in Docker containers as root (unlike bypassPermissions)
- **What it does**: Auto-approves file operations (Edit, Write, mkdir, rm)
- **Trade-off**: Less security control, more convenience
- **Verdict**: Acceptable for dev environment, reconsider for production

### Memory: 2GB
- **Calculation**:
  - PDF: 48MB
  - React PDF Viewer: ~300MB peak
  - Node.js server: ~300MB
  - Claude Code session: ~400MB during processing
  - Total: ~1GB peak, 2GB provides comfortable headroom
- **Cost**: Minimal increase on Fly.io
- **Result**: Instance no longer freezes

### Script Location: /workspace/tools/scripts/
- **Why**: Accessible from both container and host
- **Previously**: In lib/claude-webui-server/scripts (not in workspace-template)
- **Now**: In workspace-template, automatically copied to container

---

## Open Questions

1. **Claude API Rate Limits**: Will processing 34 chunks hit rate limits?
2. **Concurrent Users**: How will multiple simultaneous PDF uploads affect memory?
3. **Chunk Size**: Is 15 pages optimal, or should we adjust based on PDF density?
4. **Error Recovery**: What happens if processing fails halfway through?

---

## Files Modified This Session

1. `/workspace/my-jarvis/projects/my-jarvis-desktop/app/hooks/chat/usePermissionMode.ts`
   - Changed default from "bypassPermissions" to "acceptEdits"

2. `/workspace/my-jarvis/projects/my-jarvis-desktop/fly.toml`
   - Line 45: `memory = "2gb"` (was "1gb")

3. `/workspace/my-jarvis/projects/my-jarvis-desktop/workspace-template/my-jarvis/docs/knowledge-base-guide.md`
   - Fixed script path references (lib/claude-webui-server/scripts → tools/scripts)

4. `/workspace/my-jarvis/projects/my-jarvis-desktop/scripts/init-workspace.sh`
   - Temporarily commented out workspace existence check (then restored)

5. `/workspace/tools/scripts/deploy-my-jarvis-erez-dev.sh`
   - Updated Fly API token

6. `/workspace/tools/scripts/copy-to-my-jarvis-erez-dev.sh`

## Deployment Status

### my-jarvis-erez-dev
- **State**: Running
- **Memory**: 2048MB (upgraded from 1024MB)
- **Health**: Passing (1/1 checks)
- **Image**: deployment-01K7ZM231X06RQ17KKGHFA6AE4
- **Region**: sjc
- **Hostname**: my-jarvis-erez-dev.fly.dev

### Known Issues
- PDF processing hangs after 60 seconds due to Fly.io idle timeout
- No progress feedback during long operations

---

## Recommended Next Actions

1. **Immediate**: Implement keep-alive/progress streaming in chat handler
2. **Safety**: Add client-side 3-minute timeout
3. **UX**: Add progress indicator in UI ("Processing chunk X of Y")
4. **Testing**: Verify with multiple PDF sizes (10 pages, 50 pages, 300 pages)
5. **Documentation**: Update knowledge-base-guide.md with timeout limitations

## Session Context for Next Chat

**Where we left off**:
- Root cause identified (Fly.io 60s idle timeout)
- Solution clear (keep-alive mechanism)
- Ready to implement streaming progress updates

**What works**:
- PDF upload and chunking
- Memory no longer an issue
- Permission system fixed

**What doesn't work**:
- Long-running Claude sessions timeout after 60s of silence
- No user feedback during processing

**Critical path**: Implement progress streaming to keep Fly.io connection alive during chunk processing.
