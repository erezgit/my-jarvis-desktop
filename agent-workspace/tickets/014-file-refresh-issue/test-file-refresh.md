# Test File for Refresh Testing

Created at: 2025-09-23 03:34

This file was created to test if the file tree updates when:
1. You close and reopen a folder
2. You manually refresh
3. The watcher detects changes

If you can see this file in your desktop app's file tree, then the refresh mechanism is working!

## Test

This section was added at 03:36 to test if clicking the file again refreshes the content.
If you see this "Test" section, then the file content is being refreshed when you click!

## Test 5 - Live Update Verification

Added at: 2025-09-23 04:14

This is test section 5 with some dummy content to verify file watching capabilities:
- Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit
- The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog
- File watching should detect this change immediately
- Click the file again to see if this new content appears

If you can see this Test 5 section after clicking the file, then the file refresh mechanism is working perfectly!

## Test 6 - Dynamic Content Refresh

Added at: 2025-09-23 04:29

Welcome to test section 6! This section contains various dummy content to test the file refresh functionality:

### Random Technical Facts
- WebSockets provide full-duplex communication channels over a single TCP connection
- The Electron framework combines Chromium and Node.js into a single runtime
- TypeScript adds static typing to JavaScript, enhancing code reliability

### Sample Code Block
```javascript
const refreshTest = {
  section: 6,
  timestamp: new Date().toISOString(),
  status: 'Testing file refresh mechanism',
  result: 'If you see this, it worked!'
};
console.log('File refresh test:', refreshTest);
```

### Quick Checklist
- [ ] File opened successfully
- [ ] Content displayed correctly
- [ ] New section visible after refresh
- [ ] File tree updated as expected

This dummy content should appear immediately when you click the file again. Happy testing!
