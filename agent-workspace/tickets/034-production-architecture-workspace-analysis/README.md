# Ticket 034: Production Architecture & Workspace Configuration Analysis

## Summary
Complete analysis of My Jarvis Desktop v1.4.2 production architecture and workspace configuration discovered during DMG build fix.

## Key Discoveries

### Production Architecture
- **Backend Model**: In-process (NOT fork/child process)
- **Implementation**: NodeRuntime creates Hono server directly in Electron main process on port 8081
- **Location**: `lib/main/main.ts` and `lib/claude-webui-server/runtime/node.ts`
- **Status**: Stable and working consistently

### DMG Build Issue Resolution
- **Problem**: "Disk not readable" error due to code signing failures
- **Solution**: Added `identity: null` to `electron-builder.yml` to disable signing
- **Result**: Successfully created working DMG for v1.4.2
- **Verification**: Confirmed with `hdiutil verify`

### Workspace Configuration
- **Development Directory**: `/Users/erezfern/Workspace/jarvis/spaces/my-jarvis-desktop/projects/my-jarvis-desktop`
- **CLAUDE.md Discovery**: Claude Code searches upward, finds main jarvis CLAUDE.md first
- **Voice Scripts**: Using main jarvis tools (`/Users/erezfern/Workspace/jarvis/tools/src/jarvis_voice.sh`)
- **Status**: Stable but potentially confusing setup

### Critical Files Modified
1. `electron-builder.yml` - Added `identity: null` (line 25)
2. `package.json` - Version 1.4.1 → 1.4.2
3. `lib/main/main.ts` - PATH enhancement for GUI launch (lines 17-32)

## Current Status
- ✅ Production build working consistently
- ✅ DMG installation successful
- ✅ Voice messages display correctly
- ❓ Voice auto-play issue remains (user concerned about breaking stable build)

## User Feedback
"It's working now pretty consistently... I find it hard to believe. I'm afraid that if we change something, it will break."

## Next Steps
- Monitor stability
- Document workspace configuration for clarity
- Address voice auto-play when safe to modify
- Consider workspace consolidation strategy

## Priority
Low - System is stable and functional for user testing
