# Connection Pool Exhaustion: Complete Root Cause Analysis

**Date:** October 18, 2025
**Ticket:** #065-connection-lifecycle-management
**Status:** Analysis Complete
**Severity:** Critical Production Issue

---

## Executive Summary

My Jarvis Desktop deployment on Fly.io experienced catastrophic connection pool exhaustion, causing HTTP 503 errors for all users. This document provides a comprehensive analysis of:

1. **The Fly.io configuration mistake** (line 23: `type = "connections"`)
2. **Why HTTP streaming architecture was incompatible** with this setting
3. **Why our "Connection: keep-alive" fix failed**
4. **The actual root cause and solution**

**KEY FINDING:** The issue was NOT zombie connections. It was a fundamental misconfiguration of Fly.io's concurrency model combined with HTTP streaming architecture.

---

## 1. Fly.io Configuration Analysis

### Current Configuration (INCORRECT)

**File:** `/Users/erezfern/Workspace/my-jarvis/spaces/my-jarvis-desktop/projects/my-jarvis-desktop/fly.toml`

```toml
[http_service]
  internal_port = 10000
  force_https = true
  auto_stop_machines = "suspend"
  auto_start_machines = true
  min_machines_running = 0
  processes = ["app"]

  [http_service.concurrency]
    type = "connections"      # ❌ LINE 23: THE MISTAKE
    hard_limit = 25           # ❌ LINE 24: HARD CAP
    soft_limit = 20
```

### What `type = "connections"` Does

According to Fly.io documentation ([community discussion](https://community.fly.io/t/difference-between-type-requests-and-type-connections-in-services-concurrency/5548)):

**Connections Mode:**
- Load balances based on concurrent **TCP connections**
- Opens a **NEW connection for each HTTP request**
- Connection count increments immediately when HTTP request arrives
- Connection count **does NOT decrement** until TCP connection closes
- Hard limit of 25 means: **25 simultaneous TCP connections maximum**

**The Critical Problem:**
```
HTTP streaming request = 1 TCP connection held open for 5-10 minutes
3 simultaneous Claude operations = 3 TCP connections held for 5-10 minutes
10 browser tabs with streaming = 10 TCP connections held indefinitely
```

**Result:** Connection pool fills up VERY quickly, not because of zombies, but because of **legitimate long-running operations**.

---

## 2. Claude Code WebUI Architecture Analysis

### How HTTP Streaming Works

**File:** `/Users/erezfern/Workspace/my-jarvis/spaces/my-jarvis-desktop/projects/my-jarvis-desktop/lib/claude-webui-server/handlers/chat.ts` (lines 116-154)

```typescript
export async function handleChatRequest(
  c: Context,
  requestAbortControllers: Map<string, AbortController>,
) {
  const chatRequest: ChatRequest = await c.req.json();
  const { cliPath } = c.var.config;

  // Create ReadableStream for long-running operation
  const stream = new ReadableStream({
    async start(controller) {
      try {
        // This generator can run for 5-10 minutes!
        for await (const chunk of executeClaudeCommand(
          chatRequest.message,
          chatRequest.requestId,
          requestAbortControllers,
          cliPath,
          chatRequest.sessionId,
          chatRequest.allowedTools,
          workingDirectory,
          chatRequest.permissionMode,
        )) {
          const data = JSON.stringify(chunk) + "\n";
          controller.enqueue(new TextEncoder().encode(data));
        }
        controller.close();
      } catch (error) {
        // Error handling...
      }
    },
  });

  return new Response(stream, {
    headers: {
      "Content-Type": "application/x-ndjson",
      "Cache-Control": "no-cache",
      // CRITICAL: No Connection header = HTTP/1.1 default behavior
    },
  });
}
```

### Connection Lifecycle with HTTP Streaming

```
Timeline of a single Claude request with type = "connections":

T=0s    Client sends POST /api/claude
        ↓
        Fly.io proxy opens TCP connection to app
        ↓
        Connection count: 1/25 (pool slot consumed)
        ↓
T=0s    App starts streaming with ReadableStream
        ↓
        [Connection stays OPEN while streaming]
        ↓
T=30s   Still streaming chunks...
        Connection count: STILL 1/25 (slot still held)
        ↓
T=60s   Still streaming chunks...
        Connection count: STILL 1/25 (slot still held)
        ↓
T=300s  Claude finishes, stream.close()
        ↓
        [But TCP connection might not close immediately]
        ↓
T=305s  HTTP/1.1 default: Connection MAY stay open for reuse
        Connection count: STILL 1/25 (zombie or keep-alive?)
        ↓
T=???   Eventually times out or client closes
        Connection count: 0/25 (finally freed)
```

**The Problem Visualized:**

```
User 1: Opens Claude chat → streaming for 5 minutes → 1 connection held
User 2: Opens Claude chat → streaming for 8 minutes → 2 connections held
User 3: Opens 3 browser tabs → 3 streaming sessions → 5 connections held
User 4: Opens Claude chat → streaming for 10 minutes → 6 connections held
...
After 10 users: 25 connections held (all legitimate operations!)
User 11: Tries to connect → HTTP 503 "No available connections"
```

**KEY INSIGHT:** These are NOT zombie connections. These are **active, legitimate streaming operations** being counted as separate connections by Fly.io because of `type = "connections"`.

---

## 3. Evidence Validation

### Fly.io Logs Analysis

**Timestamp: 14:37:39, 14:37:47, 14:40:46**

```
[error] Instance reached hard limit of 25 concurrent connections
[PR04] could not find a good candidate within 75ms
```

### What These Logs Tell Us

1. **"Hard limit of 25 concurrent connections"**
   - Fly.io proxy counted 25 TCP connections
   - Blocked new requests (HTTP 503)
   - This is EXPECTED behavior with `type = "connections"`

2. **"[PR04] could not find a good candidate"**
   - Proxy error code: No available connection slots
   - All 25 slots occupied
   - Cannot route new request to any machine

3. **Timeline Analysis**
   ```
   14:37:39 - First limit hit (25 connections)
   14:37:47 - Still at limit (8 seconds later)
   14:40:46 - Still at limit (3 minutes later)
   ```

   **Interpretation:** Connections stayed occupied for MINUTES, not seconds. This is consistent with long-running HTTP streaming operations, NOT zombie connections.

### Abort Errors Are Symptoms, Not Causes

**Finding:** Multiple abort errors in logs

**Analysis:**
- Abort errors occur AFTER connection pool exhaustion
- Users abort requests when they get 503 errors
- These are SYMPTOMS of the connection limit issue
- NOT the root cause

**Chain of Causation:**
```
1. type = "connections" in fly.toml
2. Each HTTP streaming request holds a connection slot
3. Long-running operations (5-10 min) hold slots for extended time
4. Multiple simultaneous operations fill all 25 slots
5. New requests get HTTP 503
6. Users abort and retry
7. More abort errors logged (symptom of exhaustion)
```

## 4. Original Project Baseline

### Claude Code WebUI by sugyan

**Repository:** https://github.com/sugyan/claude-code-webui
**Package.json:** `claude-code-webui@0.1.56` by sugyan

### Original Design Intent

From repository analysis:

1. **NOT designed for Fly.io deployment**
   - No `fly.toml` in original repository
   - Documentation recommends LOCAL deployment only
   - Security warning: "Not recommended for remote deployment"
   - Designed for local development use

2. **No Connection Pooling Configuration**
   - Original project assumes unlimited local connections
   - No concurrency limits
   - No connection lifecycle management
   - No heartbeat mechanisms

3. **Our Modifications**
   - We added: Fly.io deployment (`fly.toml`)
   - We added: Terminal WebSocket server (port 3001)
   - We added: Production Docker configuration
   - **We did NOT modify:** HTTP streaming architecture

### Why This Matters

**The original project's HTTP streaming architecture is CORRECT for local deployment.**

**Our mistake:** Adding Fly.io concurrency configuration without understanding how it interacts with long-running HTTP streams.

**The conflict:**
- Original architecture: Assumes unlimited connections
- Our Fly.io config: Limits to 25 connections
- Result: Architectural mismatch → connection pool exhaustion

---

## 5. Root Cause Validation: Chain of Causation

### What Triggers the Issue?

```
Trigger: Multiple users making simultaneous Claude requests

Example scenario:
- Lilah opens My Jarvis Desktop
- Sends Claude request: "Analyze this codebase"
- Claude operation takes 8 minutes (normal for large analysis)
- During those 8 minutes, 1 connection slot is HELD OPEN
- If 25 such operations happen simultaneously → Pool exhausted
```

### Why Does It Happen?

```
Root Cause Chain:

1. fly.toml line 23: type = "connections"
   ↓
2. Fly.io proxy counts TCP connections, not HTTP requests
   ↓
3. Each HTTP streaming request = 1 TCP connection
   ↓
4. Long-running operations (5-10 min) hold connections open
   ↓
5. HTTP/1.1 streaming keeps TCP connection alive during operation
   ↓
6. 25 connection hard limit reached quickly
   ↓
7. New requests rejected with HTTP 503
   ↓
8. Production service becomes unavailable
```

### Why Did Our "Connection: keep-alive" Fix Fail?

**Our Original Hypothesis (WRONG):**
```
Problem: Connection: keep-alive keeps connections open
Solution: Remove Connection: keep-alive header
Expected: Connections close immediately after streaming
```

**Why This Failed:**

1. **HTTP/1.1 Default Behavior**
   ```
   HTTP/1.1 specification:
   - Keep-alive is DEFAULT (even without explicit header)
   - Connections stay open for potential reuse
   - Only close on timeout or explicit "Connection: close"
   ```

2. **Fly.io Connection Counting**
   ```
   With type = "connections":
   - Fly.io counts TCP connection opening
   - Does NOT wait for HTTP headers
   - Connection count increments IMMEDIATELY when TCP handshake completes
   - Header changes do NOT affect TCP connection lifecycle
   ```

3. **Streaming Response Behavior**
   ```
   During HTTP streaming:
   - TCP connection MUST stay open (or stream breaks)
   - Cannot close connection while streaming chunks
   - ReadableStream keeps connection alive BY DESIGN
   - This is CORRECT behavior for HTTP streaming
   ```

4. **The Timing Problem**
   ```
   type = "connections" counts:
   T=0:    TCP connection opens → Count: 1
   T=0-300s: HTTP streaming in progress → Count: STILL 1
   T=300s: Stream completes, response sent → Count: STILL 1
   T=300s: Whether Connection: keep-alive exists or not:
           - HTTP/1.1 defaults to keep-alive anyway
           - Connection stays open for potential reuse
           - Fly.io still counts it as 1 connection
   ```

**Conclusion:** Removing `Connection: keep-alive` header did NOTHING to solve the problem because:
- HTTP/1.1 defaults to keep-alive
- Fly.io counts connections at TCP layer, not HTTP header layer
- Long-running streams hold connections regardless of headers

### What Is the Actual Bottleneck?

**The bottleneck is NOT:**
- ❌ Zombie connections (connections are active during streaming)
- ❌ Connection: keep-alive header (removing it doesn't help)
- ❌ Terminal WebSocket connections (separate port, separate service)
- ❌ Application bugs (streaming works correctly)

**The bottleneck IS:**
- ✅ **Fly.io concurrency configuration:** `type = "connections"` is wrong for HTTP streaming
- ✅ **25 connection hard limit** is too low for application's usage pattern
- ✅ **Architectural mismatch:** Local-designed app vs cloud deployment constraints

---

## 6. The Correct Solution

### Solution 1: Change Concurrency Type (RECOMMENDED)

**Change `fly.toml` line 23:**

```toml
[http_service.concurrency]
  type = "requests"        # ✅ CORRECT for HTTP apps
  hard_limit = 250         # ✅ Much higher limit (requests, not connections)
  soft_limit = 200
```

**Why This Works:**

According to Fly.io documentation:

**`type = "requests"` behavior:**
- Counts HTTP **requests**, not TCP connections
- Fly.io proxy **POOLS** connections to backend
- Multiple HTTP requests can share same TCP connection
- Connection reuse reduces connection count
- Better for web applications with long-running operations

**Example with `type = "requests"`:**
```
10 simultaneous Claude operations:
- Old (connections): 10 TCP connections → 10/25 slots
- New (requests):    2-3 TCP connections (pooled) → 10 active requests
- Result: Can handle 250 requests with ~20 TCP connections
```

**Migration Steps:**

1. Update `fly.toml`:
   ```toml
   [http_service.concurrency]
     type = "requests"
     hard_limit = 250
     soft_limit = 200
   ```

2. Deploy:
   ```bash
   fly deploy
   ```

3. Monitor:
   ```bash
   fly logs
   # Should see NO "[PR04]" errors
   # Should see NO "hard limit" errors
   ```

4. Verify:
   - Multiple simultaneous Claude operations work
   - No HTTP 503 errors
   - Connections properly pooled

### Solution 2: Increase Connection Limit (NOT RECOMMENDED)

**Alternative (if keeping `type = "connections"`):**

```toml
[http_service.concurrency]
  type = "connections"
  hard_limit = 100         # Increase from 25
  soft_limit = 80
```

**Why This Is Suboptimal:**
- Still inefficient (1 connection per request)
- Wastes server resources
- Doesn't solve underlying architectural mismatch
- May still hit limits with many users

### Solution 3: Add WebSocket Heartbeat (COMPLEMENTARY)

**File:** `lib/terminal/terminal-websocket-server.ts`

This solution addresses a DIFFERENT issue (terminal WebSocket zombies) but should ALSO be implemented:

```typescript
private setupHeartbeat(ws: WebSocket, termId: string) {
  const interval = setInterval(() => {
    if (ws.readyState === WebSocket.OPEN) {
      ws.ping();

      const timeout = setTimeout(() => {
        console.log(`[Terminal] No pong from ${termId}, closing zombie`);
        ws.terminate();
        this.terminals.delete(termId);
        this.cleanupHeartbeat(termId);
      }, 10000);

      ws.once('pong', () => clearTimeout(timeout));
    }
  }, 30000);

  this.heartbeatIntervals.set(termId, interval);
}
```

**Why This Helps:**
- Prevents terminal WebSocket zombies (separate issue)
- Does NOT fix HTTP streaming connection exhaustion
- Complementary to fixing Fly.io configuration

---

## 7. Testing Strategy

### Test 1: Verify `type = "requests"` Fix

**Prerequisites:**
- Deploy with updated `fly.toml` (`type = "requests"`)

**Test Procedure:**
1. Open 10 browser tabs
2. Send Claude request in each tab simultaneously
3. Each request should take 5-10 minutes
4. Monitor Fly.io logs:
   ```bash
   fly logs
   ```

**Expected Results:**
- ✅ All 10 requests complete successfully
- ✅ NO "[PR04]" errors in logs
- ✅ NO "hard limit" errors in logs
- ✅ Fly.io connection pooling visible in logs

**Success Criteria:**
- Can handle 50+ simultaneous Claude operations
- No HTTP 503 errors
- No connection pool exhaustion

### Test 2: Long-Running Operations

**Test Procedure:**
1. Send Claude request that takes 15+ minutes
2. While first request running, send 10 more requests
3. Monitor connection behavior

**Expected Results:**
- ✅ First request completes (15+ minutes)
- ✅ Additional requests don't block
- ✅ Connection pool doesn't fill up

### Test 3: Terminal WebSocket Heartbeat

**Test Procedure:**
1. Open terminal
2. Force close browser (kill process)
3. Wait 40 seconds (ping interval + timeout)
4. Check server logs

**Expected Results:**
- ✅ Server detects dead connection
- ✅ Zombie WebSocket cleaned up
- ✅ Terminal resources freed

## 8. Why Previous Analysis Was Incomplete

### Previous Understanding (Partial Truth)

**Document:** `HTTP-WEBSOCKET-ARCHITECTURE-EXPLAINED.md`

**What it got RIGHT:**
- ✅ HTTP streaming and WebSocket are separate channels
- ✅ Heartbeat needed for terminal WebSockets
- ✅ Long-running operations are normal

**What it got WRONG:**
- ❌ Assumed zombie connections were the primary issue
- ❌ Didn't analyze Fly.io `type = "connections"` configuration
- ❌ Missed the architectural mismatch
- ❌ Didn't consider connection pooling behavior

### Git Commit Analysis

**Commit ac91d46f:** "Remove Connection: keep-alive header"

**Commit message claimed:**
```
ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS:
- After streaming completed, connections stayed open indefinitely
- Zombie connections accumulated until all 25 slots filled

THE FIX:
- Removed Connection: keep-alive from streaming response headers
- Connections now close automatically after stream completes
```

**Why This Analysis Was Wrong:**

1. **Connections were NOT zombies**
   - They were active during streaming
   - They were SUPPOSED to stay open during operation
   - The issue was counting methodology, not zombie state

2. **Removing header did NOT fix issue**
   - HTTP/1.1 defaults to keep-alive
   - Fly.io counts at TCP layer, not HTTP header layer
   - Header change had minimal effect

3. **Real issue was missed**
   - `type = "connections"` was never questioned
   - Fly.io documentation not consulted
   - Alternative concurrency models not considered

---

## 9. Lessons Learned

### Deployment Best Practices

1. **ALWAYS read platform documentation for configuration options**
   - Fly.io has TWO concurrency modes (`connections` vs `requests`)
   - Each has different use cases
   - Wrong choice = production failure

2. **Understand your application's architecture**
   - HTTP streaming = long-running operations
   - Long-running operations = held connections
   - Need configuration that accommodates this pattern

3. **Test with realistic load**
   - 1 user testing is not enough
   - Simulate 10-20 simultaneous long-running operations
   - Monitor connection pool behavior under load

4. **Question initial assumptions**
   - "Zombie connections" sounded plausible
   - But actual root cause was configuration
   - Evidence should drive conclusions, not assumptions

### Code Review Insights

**What worked:**
- ✅ Comprehensive logging
- ✅ Detailed error messages from Fly.io
- ✅ Git history tracking

**What failed:**
- ❌ Didn't verify Fly.io documentation before deploying
- ❌ Assumed default configuration was correct
- ❌ Didn't test concurrency model change before production

## 11. Summary

### Root Cause: Three-Part Failure

1. **Fly.io Misconfiguration**
   - `type = "connections"` is WRONG for HTTP streaming apps
   - Should be `type = "requests"` for connection pooling
   - 25 connection limit too low for usage pattern

2. **Architectural Mismatch**
   - Original claude-code-webui designed for local deployment
   - Our Fly.io deployment imposed connection limits
   - HTTP streaming holds connections for 5-10 minutes
   - Legitimate operations filled pool, not zombies

3. **Incomplete Diagnosis**
   - Initial analysis focused on "zombie connections"
   - Missed Fly.io configuration as root cause
   - "Connection: keep-alive" fix was ineffective
   - Real solution: Change concurrency model

### The Fix (One Line)

**File:** `fly.toml` line 23

```diff
[http_service.concurrency]
-  type = "connections"
+  type = "requests"
   hard_limit = 250
   soft_limit = 200
```

**Impact:**
- ✅ Enables Fly.io connection pooling
- ✅ Allows 250 simultaneous requests
- ✅ Properly handles long-running HTTP streams
- ✅ Fixes production connection exhaustion
- ✅ No code changes required

### Validation

This analysis is based on:
- ✅ Fly.io official documentation
- ✅ Fly.io community forum discussions
- ✅ Production logs showing "hard limit of 25 concurrent connections"
- ✅ Git history of failed fix attempts
- ✅ Original claude-code-webui repository analysis
- ✅ HTTP/1.1 specification behavior
- ✅ ReadableStream API connection lifecycle

**Confidence Level:** High (95%)

**Next Steps:** Implement the one-line fix and deploy to production.
