The workspace root at /workspace is actually a Docker volume mount point. When you run the Docker container, it mounts the workspace directory to persist your files. The app, lib, and node_modules directories at the root are the compiled web version of My Jarvis - this is what gets deployed to production for the web interface. Your actual development project lives nested inside at my-jarvis/projects/my-jarvis-desktop. The root level is essentially the production web build that serves the Claude WebUI interface, while the nested project is the full Electron desktop application source code. The Dockerfile shows this setup - it copies app and lib directories, builds them for production web deployment, and then mounts /workspace as a persistent volume. So you have two layers: the production web app at root, and the full desktop development project nested inside.\\\"\"\n      }\n    ],\n    \"behavior\": \"allow\",\n    \"destination\": \"localSettings\"\n  }\n]"
