I was overcomplicating it. Let me clarify. You don''t need external Claude API calls. I AM the automation. Here''s the simpler flow: User uploads PDF. We save it. I run a Python script using Bash that chunks the PDF into smaller pieces and extracts all the text from each chunk into markdown files. That''s it. That''s the critical part. The Python script uses pdfplumber to read the PDF and extract every word into text files. Once we have all those text markdown files in the workspace, then later I can just read them myself during our conversation. I don''t call any external API for summarization. I just read the markdown files and answer your questions. The summarization and indexing can happen naturally - I read all the chunks and create summary files myself by reading and writing, just like I do with any other file. So the core technical challenge is: can we extract all text from a 300 page PDF into markdown files? Yes. The Python library pdfplumber is built exactly for this. It reads PDFs page by page and extracts text while preserving structure. We run it, it creates markdown files with all the text, done. Same with Word documents using python-docx library. Does this make more sense? It''s much simpler than I made it sound.\\\"\"\n      }\n    ],\n    \"behavior\": \"allow\",\n    \"destination\": \"localSettings\"\n  }\n]"
