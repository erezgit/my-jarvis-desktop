I''ve read through the architecture document and ticket 63 for the My Jarvis Desktop project. I''m ready to discuss the knowledge base builder implementation. Here''s what I understand: Ticket 63 is about building a knowledge base system for Lilach, who''s your first real external user. The goal is to let users upload large PDF and Word documents, automatically process them into structured markdown chunks, and make that content accessible to Jarvis during conversations. The implementation plan is comprehensive - it covers the full stack from frontend file upload, to backend Node.js processing, to Python scripts for document chunking and AI summarization using Claude API, and finally integration with conversation context. The architecture uses a chunking strategy where large documents get split into 10-15 page chunks, each chunk becomes a markdown file, and Claude generates both a summary and an index with descriptions. This is a high-priority feature with real user validation. I''m ready to dive into the codebase and discuss next steps. What would you like to focus on first?\\\"\"\n      }\n    ],\n    \"behavior\": \"allow\",\n    \"destination\": \"localSettings\"\n  }\n]"
