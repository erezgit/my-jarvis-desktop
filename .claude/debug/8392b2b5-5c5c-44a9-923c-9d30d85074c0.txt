The key findings: Fly.io offers programmatic container creation via their Machines API, enabling each user to get their own isolated Docker container with full Claude Code capabilities. Major advantages include per-second billing with autostop/autostart, which drops costs 50 to 90 percent compared to always-on containers like Render. Each user machine boots in 300 milliseconds when idle, with complete isolation at VM level for security. Pricing runs about 50 cents to 5 dollars per user monthly depending on usage patterns, versus 700 to 1000 dollars monthly for 100 users on Render. The architecture preserves all power-user features - bash access, git operations, file system control, build tools - which would be impossible with SDK-only approaches. Bottom line: Fly.io is the optimal choice for scaling My Jarvis Desktop while maintaining full functionality and keeping costs reasonable.\\\"\"\n      }\n    ],\n    \"behavior\": \"allow\",\n    \"destination\": \"localSettings\"\n  }\n]"

Here''s exactly what''s happening: In mobile view, when you switch between panels like files, preview, and chat, the chat interface component stays mounted in the DOM but becomes hidden. The problem is in ResponsiveLayout dot TSX on line 61. The chatElement is wrapped in useMemo with currentView as a dependency. This means every time you navigate away from chat and back, even though it''s just changing panels in mobile, React sees currentView changed and recreates the entire ChatPage component. When ChatPage remounts, all its child components remount too, including VoiceMessageComponent. Now here''s the critical bug: The voice played tracker IS working correctly and remembers which messages were played. But look at VoiceMessageComponent line 18 to 46. The useEffect that handles autoplay has message dot autoPlay and message dot audioUrl as dependencies. When the component remounts after panel switching, this useEffect runs again. The autoPlay property is still true on the message object because nothing clears it. So the logic checks: Is autoPlay true? Yes. Does audioRef exist? Yes after remount. Has this been played according to tracker? No wait, it should say yes. Let me check the flow again. Actually, the tracker DOES say it''s been played, so hasPlayed returns true, which should prevent replay. But you''re saying it plays the first time you switch panels. This means the autoPlay flag itself must be getting set again somehow, or there''s a race condition. Wait, I need to check if the issue is that when you switch panels in mobile, the ChatPage component gets completely recreated due to that useMemo dependency, and maybe the message object itself is being recreated with autoPlay true again. That would bypass the tracker check. The fix is simple: Remove currentView from the useMemo dependencies in ResponsiveLayout. The ChatPage doesn''t need to remount when currentView changes because it handles that view internally with props. That''s causing unnecessary component recreation and triggering the autoPlay logic again even though the tracker is working.\\\"\"\n      }\n    ],\n    \"behavior\": \"allow\",\n    \"destination\": \"localSettings\"\n  }\n]"
